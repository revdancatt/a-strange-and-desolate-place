## Keypresses

't' - toggle background texture on/off
'h' - toggle high resolution  
's' - save PNG file  
'1-6' - save A1 to A6 SVG files  

## Printing

The high resolution image outputs at 5,809 x 8,192 pixels.  

Print 19.4" x 27.3" at 300dpi
Print 49.2cm x 69.4cm  at 300dpi

Add `?forceWidth=xxxx` where xxxx is the pixels size you want. For example to print at 100cm high, the width would need to be 70.72cm. 70.72cm in inches is 27.84" at 300dpi = 8,352 pixels width. So using `?forceWidth=8352` and downloading will give you an PNG large enough to be safely printed at 1 meter height.
